# 8-Puzzle
The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order. Blocks are permitted to slide horizontally or vertically into the blank square, leaving its previous position empty in turn. This problem can be solved by searching for a solution, which is a sequence of actions (tile moves) that leads from the initial state to the goal state. BFS, DFS, A* search algorithms are implemented to solve the 8-puzzle. Each tackles the problem in a different way and using different data structures
